The ipumsr package assists in the import and use of IPUMS extracts in R. IPUMS
data is a repackaging of census and survey data from around the world to a
format harmonized across space and time and with enhanced
documentation. With IPUMS data, it easy to study change, conduct comparative
research, merge information across data types, and analyze individuals within
family and community context. Users can go to the 
[IPUMS website](https://usa.ipums.org) and create an extract with only the 
samples and variables they are interested in, and then import their downloaded
extract with the ipumsr package. Work has begun on an API for IPUMS data, but 
it is not known when it will be available. 

Several IPUMS projects include data from the US Census Bureau:

- [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org) repackages the public use microdata from 
the US Census and American Community Survey from 1850 to the present.
- [NHGIS](https://nhgis.org) provides population, housing, agricultural, 
and economic data, along with GIS-compatible boundary files, for geographic 
units in the United States from 1790 to the present.
- [IPUMS CPS](https://cps.ipums.org) provides the Current Population Survey 
which is a monthly workforce survey conducted by the Census Bureau.
- [IPUMS International](https://international.ipums.org) includes the
US Census microdata in the same format as census data from 93 other
countries.

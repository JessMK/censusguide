"<a href=""https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SeerMapper/index.html""> SeerMapper </a>","A Quick Way to Map U.S. Rates and Data of U. S. States, Counties, Census Tracts, or Seer Registries using 2000 and 2010 U. S. Census Boundaries","Provides an easy way to map seer registry area rate data on a U. S, map. The U. S. data may be mapped at the state, U. S. NCI Seer Register, state/county or census tract level. The function can categorize the data into ""n"" quantiles, where ""n"" is 3 to 11 or the caller can specify a cut point list for the categorizes. The caller can also provide the data and the comparison operation to request hatching over any areas. The default operation and value are > 0.05 (p-values). The location id provided in the data determines the geographic level of the mapping. If states, state/counties or census tracts are being mapped, the location ids used must be the U.S. FIPS codes for states (2 digits), state/counties (5 digits) or state/county/census tracts (11 digits). If the location id references the U.S. Seer Registry areas, the Seer Registry area identifier used to link the data to the geographical areas, then the location id is the Seer Registry name or abbreviation. Additional parameters are used to provide control over the drawing of the boundaries at the data's boundary level and higher levels. The package uses modified boundary data from the 2000 and 2010 U. S. Census to reduce the storage requirements and improve drawing speed. The 'SeerMapper' package contains the U. S. Census 2000 and 2010 boundary data for the regional, state, Seer Registry, and county levels. Six supplement packages contain the census tract boundary data (see manual for more details.)"

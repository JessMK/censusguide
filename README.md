Guide to Working with Census Data in R
===

This repository contains a draft of the R Consortium Census Working Group's _Guide to Working with Census Data in R_.

The proposal which resulted in the funding for this project can be viewed [here](initial-proposal.md).

We are currently working towards Milestone 2 of the Guide, which is described in the proposal like this:

_**Assemble list of resources to include**_

_The initial package and resource lists will be based on our personal knowledge and experience. The lists will be stored in github so that other people can contribute to the lists. That github repository will then be publicized via our blogs and social media accounts._

_This milestone will be completed when we have the final list of Package and Training resources that we plan to include in the guide._

The current draft of R packages we are considering including in the Guide can be found [here](r-packages.html).

Guide to Working with Census Data in R
===

This repository contains a draft of the R Consortium Census Working Group's _Guide to Working with Census Data in R_.

The proposal which resulted in the funding for this project can be viewed in the file _initial-proposal.md_.

This project has 4 milestones:

1. Select Publication Technology

Our first task will be selecting technology to use to publish the Guide. We would like the technology to be free and easy to access, as well as free to host and easy to update. We are planning to start this phase by evaluating Github, Github Pages and WordPress.

This milestone will be completed when there is a "Hello World" version of the Guide published, and both authors understand the workflow for editing it.

2. Assemble list of resources to include

The initial package and resource lists will be based on our personal knowledge and experience. The lists will be stored in github so that other people can contribute to the lists. That github repository will then be publicized via our blogs and social media accounts.

This milestone will be completed when we have the final list of Package and Training resources that we plan to include in the guide.

3. Complete Publication of Guide

After we have the final list of resources we plan to include in the Guide, we will need to write up the results.

This milestone will be completed once the final draft of the Guide is published.

We plan to announce completion of this milestone on our blogs and social media accounts.

4. Complete Dissemination

Once the Guide is completed, we will focus on disseminating it to the largest possible audience.

We will start by simply announcing the Guide's completion on our blogs and social media accounts.

We will also reach out to the Census Bureau, which has already indicated an interest in linking to it from their website.

We also believe that CRAN might want to link to the Guide on the Official Statistics & Survey Methodology Task View. However, we have not yet spoken to the Task View Maintainer about this. If the maintainer thinks that this project is not a perfect fit, then we are open to creating a separate task view dedicated to US Census Statistics.

A sample of the most popular datasets, based on Logan's list of API traffic. In the final version of the Guide,
we would want to have a paragraph or two for each of these datasets.
  * [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/)
  * [Decennial Census of Population and Housing](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html)
  * [Population Estimates Program](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest.html)
  * [Survey of Business Owners](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sbo.html)
  * [International Data Base](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/international-programs/about/idb.html)

We would then want to clarify that the above list is by means the totality of all the data that Census publishes.
In fact, Census runs over 100 Censuses, Surveys and Programs. The full list can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/censuses.html).
